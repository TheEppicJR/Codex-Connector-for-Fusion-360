Doccumentation
	Right clicking and poening in a new tab dose not work in the API docs, its incrediby annoying
	For methods and properties of a Object should show more basic info about them (ie a link to the object(s) required in the argument and preferably just have all the information for the method in a drop down instead of giving it a whole page, I end up needing like 50 tabs because all the information i need is on diffrent tabs
	More of the information should be in header files
	The code examples should be written with better CAD practices shown, primarily it would be useful to see more code for like properly dimentioning features and ect, which is not shown in the existing samples
	The CommandInputs sample in particular is very hard to follow because the examples for every CommandInput are all intertwined
	The code examples should have code highlighting
	The Code examples for a object should be on the bottom of the page for a object
General
	The CAM API is pretty useless because there isnt enough features to acomplish most of what anyone would want to do with it
	IMHO everything shouldnt run on the main thread by default because then when something inevatibly fails the whole things dies, NX does this and its especially nice when you can cancel processes that are broken and are hanging
	How are you intended to deal with other python requirments when you are distributing a addin? like a requirments.txt, just including them directly is kinda ass. "To do this you install the Python module in the same directory as your script or a subdirectory." is not something i really know how to do, i just want to be like 'pip install xxxxx' and any more effort than that is too much of a barrier to entery (I spent like 6 hours stummped on this problem the first time i tried to use the fusion api)
	Its not obvious how important all the deleteMe()'s (cmdCntrl.deleteMe() and FeatureCmdDef.deleteMe())in the stop method are, and if you copy code from multiple examples you get unclear error messages every time you try to reload the addin without reloading Fusion
	It would be really nice to have a way to store Secrets in Fusion (like API keys to web connected addins)
	The Selection Filter should allow graphical objects (mainly to unselect objects that that were deleted in the operation)
	The Selection Filter sholud have the chain selection helper thing that exists in the CAM enviorment as a option
	(As a side note how to unselect a element of a chain in the normal chamfer and fillet features is a mistery to me, it should be obvious)
	What does createForAssemblyContext really do?
	It would be nice to have a actually documented list of the layout of the UI and what things are named to place them in the UI, its hard to know what things are called in the UI dump vs their symbol that I already know
	ObjectCollection.create() should return a ObjectCollection to me as far as Python is concerned so I dont have to do...
		delFaces: adsk.core.ObjectCollection = adsk.core.ObjectCollection.create()
		...all the time so it knows what type it is, it may exist with some other types as well (valueInput.createByXxxx and Application.get() are examples)
	Any argument of messageBox should be cast to a str, its annoying to have to do it myself every time and forgetting

Geometry
	Cells, CoEdges, Loops, Lumps, Shells, Vertices, and Wires are not given a good introduction
	Having a Object that is just a collection of one type of geometry Objects when every feature wants a Object Collection is kinda weird and confusing to deal with first
	The Chamfer Feature API should tell me what edge is the problem if it fails
	If SurfaceDeleteFaceFeature splits a body into two bodies then they should be returned when I access the .bodies property, same goes for .faces

TLDR: Doing any actual geometric computation has a very steep learning curve because the doccumentation is confusing and hard to follow, and its hard to know what you need

	As someone with a more MechE background there are too many big hurtles to jump to be able to get a lot done, and these this document is supposed to doccument most of the problems i faced
	It would be nice to have a addin that would save the modle and structure of a doccument to be able to copy it, ie CAD a bolt, see what the object structure of what you caded is, and directly copy it to make a API that CAD's a bolt parametricly
